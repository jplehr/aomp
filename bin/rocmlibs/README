Notes on build and install of rocmlibs with the AOMP development compiler.

- AOMP is the AMD development compiler based on upstream LLVM-20 and the
  amd-staging branch of llvm-project.  AOMP builds the full LLVM compiler stack
  and supporting components such as rocgdb, rocprofiler, and rocminfo.
  However, those components does not include any of the ROCm math libraries.

- Everything to build and install of rocmlibs for AOMP is in this subdirectory
  aomp/bin/rocmlibs including this README.  The parent directory aomp/bin is 
  contains all the original AOMP component build scripts and test scripts.

- The top level script is build_rocmlibs.sh. It is optional and can only be 
  run after successful execution of build_aomp.sh.  Because it is optional,
  the rocmlibs components will not be added to build_aomp.sh.

- The components that build_rocmlibs.sh builds and installs are:
  ../build_prereq.sh
  ../build_rocm-cmake.sh
  build_rocblas.sh
  build_rocprim.sh
  build_rocsparse.sh
  build_rocsolver.sh 
  build_hipblas.sh

- The build of all these libraries can take a long time.  It is recommended
  to run this command to build and install all the rocmlibs components:
 
  nohup ./build_rocmlibs.sh &

  This will provide a log of your build in the file nohup.out.

- build_rocmlibs.sh will call each of the above scripts twice. The first
  is with no arguments to do the actual build. The 2nd is with the single
  argument "install" to install the component into $AOMP. The 2nd execution
  will only occur if the build was successful. 

- These systems dependencies are needed to build rocmlibs:
  apt-get install make python3 python3-yaml python3-venv python3-joblib libmsgpack-dev libfmt-dev
  Eventually, these will get added to aomp/docs/SOURCEINSTALL_PREREQUISITE.md 

- Currently we disable Tensile for build_rocblas.sh

- It appears that TensileCreateLibrary args are not getting set from cmake.py
  This is not a problem while we currently do not use Tensile. 

- We are using the AOMP patch subsystem to manage changes we need to make to
  rocmlibs. This subsystem allows us to stay current with current repos without commiting 
  our fix. The patch is applied by build_<components>.sh and then 
  removed after successful build and install. For example, see the file 
  patches/rocblas.patch for our changes to rocBLAS repository for gfx1103.
